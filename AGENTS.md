# Repository instructions

These instructions apply to people and coding agents changing this repository. The live
triage procedure is in `.claude/skills/issue-triage/SKILL.md` and the body of
`.github/workflows/issue-triage.md`.

## Purpose and layout

This is a sandbox for first-pass issue triage, evaluated with historical `electron/electron`
issues. Nothing here is deployed to Electron, and no command may write to `electron/electron`.
Read [docs/CODEBASE.md](docs/CODEBASE.md) for the execution flow and every Python script's role.

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/issue-triage.md` | Workflow source: triggers, permissions, tools, outputs and budgets |
| `.github/workflows/issue-triage.lock.yml` | Generated workflow; never edit by hand |
| `.claude/skills/issue-triage/` | Skill procedure, three scripts, label allowlist and component hints |
| `scripts/prepare_issue.py` | Save the triggering issue as `.triage/issue.json` before the agent runs |
| `scripts/prepare_agent_context.py` | Remove grading material and future corpus rows from the disposable Actions checkout |
| `scripts/post_triage_comment.py` | Validate a safe-output request, render templates and post the comment |
| `.github/workflows/drift-check.yml` | The golden drift rerun; no AI, no secrets |
| `data/` | Frozen search corpus and Electron label snapshot |
| `evals/golden/` | Frozen rubric, 30 cases, expected outcomes, actual outputs and reports |
| `evals/tools/`, `evals/need/`, `evals/controls/` | Evaluation utilities, analysis of the need for automation, control records |
| `tests/` | Offline script and configuration tests |

## Build and test

There is no application build. Python 3.10 or later and the standard library are sufficient
for the scripts and unit tests. Do not add dependencies to the skill scripts: their runtime
has no package installation step.

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
gh aw compile issue-triage --strict --no-check-update
```

Compile after editing the workflow source and commit its regenerated lock file; CI fails on a
stale lock. Historical runs used `gh aw` v0.93.2; record the compiler version for any new
experiment. The workflows in `evals/controls/` are inert records of what ran; do not edit them.

Analysis commands write local reports. Follow the disposable-copy instructions in
[evals/golden/README.md](evals/golden/README.md) before regenerating evidence. Always select the
dataset explicitly, for example `score.py --runs final` or `skill_check.py --runs final`.
`replay.py` defaults to `agent`, which is an older experiment. Running `baseline.py` without
`--out` overwrites the historical baseline with output from the current scripts.

## Editing rules

- Preserve the frozen evaluation: `evals/golden/RUBRIC.md`, `cases/*/input.json`,
  `cases/*/expected.json` and `evals/tools/score.py` were fixed in commit `4baa2cb`.
  Record disagreements in `DESIGN.md` or a separate audit; do not adjust the target after
  observing results. Add new regression tests outside the frozen golden cases.
- Do not widen the agent's power. Keep agent permissions at `read`; do not add a `github`
  tool, more `bash` commands, top-level `jobs:`, or a safe output other than `add-labels` and
  the `triage-comment` job. Never add `add-comment`, `close-issue`, `update-issue`,
  `remove-labels`, `create-pull-request`, `merge-pull-request` or `GH_AW_GITHUB_TOKEN`.
  The configuration tests reject these changes; any proposed expansion needs owner review.
- Keep the label allowlists consistent. Workflow patterns in `safe-outputs.add-labels.allowed`
  cover the full list in `.claude/skills/issue-triage/assets/allowed-labels.txt`. Change them
  together. A test checks that each listed label matches a workflow pattern.
- Comments come from fixed templates in `render_comment.py`.
  `scripts/post_triage_comment.py` validates and posts them. Preserve its target check, output
  limit and requirement for a successful threat-detection verdict.
- Do not tune the skill on the golden cases. Use Q2 2026 issues in `evals/data/` for development.
  The component hints were drafted after the golden inputs were read; this existing limitation
  is disclosed in `DESIGN.md`. Do not add further hints from those cases.
- Preserve historical outputs and logs. New script behavior does not retroactively validate
  old live runs. Use a separate experiment or disposable copy for reruns, and record the
  source commit, model identifier, compiler version and any missing runs.
- Use `evals/tools/replay.py` for sandbox issue creation. It breaks `@mentions` and rewrites
  cross-repository references. Do not bypass that protection or aim replay at Electron.
- Keep code readable: give functions and variables concrete names, document inputs and side
  effects, and explain non-obvious constraints in comments. Prefer small standard-library
  scripts over new abstractions or dependencies.

## Labels used here

- `component/*` identifies the Electron API or feature in the report.
- `blocked/need-repro` asks for an Electron Fiddle reproduction.
- `blocked/upstream ❌` indicates a possible Chromium or Node.js cause.
- `blocked/need-info ❌` and `needs-template` are applied by replay to represent Electron's
  opening-time bot actions; the agent cannot add them.
